# Challenges-of-Deep-Neural-Network-Training

The primary objectives of this research are as follows:

Define each of the four challenges in-depth: We will provide detailed explanations of the challenges faced during DNN training, including issues related to convergence, vanishing/exploding gradients, overfitting, and computational complexity.

Explore potential solutions: For each challenge, we will investigate various solutions proposed in the literature. These could include advanced optimization algorithms, weight initialization techniques, regularization methods, and architectural modifications.

Implement selected solutions: We plan to implement some of the identified solutions in practical experiments. This will allow us to demonstrate how these methods can effectively mitigate the challenges and enhance the performance of deep neural networks.

Practical Recommendations: Ultimately, we aim to offer practical recommendations for tuning hyperparameters in deep neural network models.
